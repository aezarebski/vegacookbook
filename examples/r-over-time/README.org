** Steps

1. Extract the data from the figure (by hand!)
2. Use Gpick to get the colours out, although there is some difficulty getting
   the opacity correct.

Here is a reasonable approximation to the data in the BBC figure.

Here is is the actual specification of the figure. Since there is not a simple
primitive for an arrow, I've left this for inclusion with a vector editor. There
is also the missing background box from behind the text, but this might also be
a good candidate for leaving to a vector graphics editor.
